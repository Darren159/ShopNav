# ShopNav
Orbital Project, Mr.Impatient

## Development Plan

We plan to start by developing the core features of the app: mall navigation and shop search. Once these features are stable, we will implement personalized recommendations. Throughout the development process, we will continue to refine the user interface and improve the accuracy of our recommendations.

## Level of Achievement
Apollo

ShopNav is a mobile application that provides a  One-stop solution for efficient mall navigation and personalized shop recommendation.

## Description

It simplifies the mall navigation experience by providing users with an interactive mall directory, a powerful shop search feature, and personalized shop recommendations. This application aims to streamline the shopping experience, save time, and introduce users to new stores that align with their preferences.

## Problem Motivation

Navigating large shopping malls can be a confusing and time-consuming task. Shoppers often struggle to find specific stores or services, and they may miss out on new stores that match their interests.

## Solution Description & Impact

Our app provides a detailed, interactive directory of shopping malls, making it easy for users to find specific shops and services. Additionally, our personalized recommendation feature introduces users to shops they may be interested in, enhancing their shopping experience and potentially increasing foot traffic for stores. This solution makes shopping trips more efficient and enjoyable, benefiting both shoppers and stores.

## Core Features & User Stories(UNSURE OF STORIES)
1. **Mall Directory**: As a user, I want to be able to see the layout of the mall so that I know what are the stores available.
2. **Mall Navigation**: As a user, I want to be able to navigate the mall efficiently so I can spend less time finding the stores I need.
3. **Shop Search**: As a user, I want to search for specific stores so I can easily locate them in the mall.
4. **Personalized Recommendations**: As a user, I want to receive personalized shop recommendations so I can discover new stores that align with my interests.

## Use Cases(UNSURE)

1. **Mall Navigation**: User opens the app and chooses their current mall from a list. The app shows an interactive map of the mall, with the user's current location marked.
2. **Shop Search**: User enters a store name in the search bar. The app shows where the store is located in the mall and the best route from the user's current location.
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on the user's shopping history and preferences, the app suggests other stores in the mall that the user may be interested in.

## How the App Works

When the user opens the app, they can select their current mall, search for stores, or view personalized recommendations. The interactive map guides them to their chosen store, and the personalized recommendations adapt based on the user's shopping history and preferences.

## Database Use + Structure(not sure)

The app uses a relational database with tables for users, stores, malls, and shopping history. Each mall has a list of stores, each user has a shopping history, and each store has a list of associated malls.

## System Testing(not sure)

We use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure our system works as expected. Unit tests cover individual components, integration tests cover interactions between components, and end-to-end tests cover complete user flows. We plan to continue developing these tests as we add new features.
